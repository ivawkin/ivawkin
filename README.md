## 👨‍🍳 → 👨‍💻 My Career Journey

I’ve spent years working as a full-time chef, working hard and solving problems under pressure. Now, I’m pivoting into tech — specifically into **IT support** and **cybersecurity** — bringing with me that same work ethic, curiosity, and drive to learn fast and adapt even faster.

Every day before work, I carve out time to study, build, and grow. Whether it’s a PowerShell script to automate tasks, a TryHackMe challenge to test my hacking skills, or setting up a home lab with VMs — I’m all in.

---

## 💻 What I'm Learning

- **CompTIA A+** (New Core 1 & 2)
- **Cybersecurity Basics** (TryHackMe, Wireshark, Kali Linux)
- **IT Support Skills**
  - Windows troubleshooting
  - Networking fundamentals
  - Scripting with PowerShell & Bash
  - Virtual machines, snapshots, and sandboxing
